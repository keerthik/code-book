# About CODE-BOOK

This is a learning resource for programming using a concept called "adaptive git-learn" that grows with the reader, or allows advanced readers to jump in at the level of nuance appropriate for them.

# How to Use
This book can* be read straight from github.com using the repository viewer and default markdown viewers.

Preferably, a basic understanding of git is useful* to use this AGL book to its full potential.

Running code may* require checking out the repository or downloading code folders to run locally.

Start from the [`master`](https://github.com/keerthik/code-book/) branch of the repository. Use any cues in the content to switch to a branch with more in-context detail where needed. See the root `README` file for tips on branches for basic topics.

This section will constantly evolve based on the branch and feedback from readers.

\* *Doesn't mean it's necessary*

# New Resources
To create a new AGL "book" or resource for a topic sufficiently different from $CODE-BOOK, retaining most of this about folder

# Disclaimer
This repository is a **proof of concept** and **work in progress**

## Development
The ideal state for this book is probably not being viewed on github.com as a standard repository, developed by typing raw text into .md files. However, this is a very powerful framework for us to test this concept and work on the content.

# Acknowledgments
This book was written while providing basic guidance and instruction to Nivetha. I appreciate her patience while I bugged her for feedback as I worked on this.
