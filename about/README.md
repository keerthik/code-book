# About CODE-BOOK

This is a learning resource for programming using a concept called "adaptive git-learn" that grows with the reader, or allows advanced readers to jump in at the level of nuance appropriate for them.

# Adaptive Git-Learn
## Concept
Most textbooks are static in terms of content, and it's up to the reader to pick and choose relevant content. This results in three undesirable learning contexts:
1. Overwhelming details and nuances when being introduced to something new and complex making grokking a subject harder
2. Distracting trivialities and basics when looking to learn an advanced detail of a subtopic
3. Inconsistent pacing increasing complexity results in either boredom or confusion

In general I think (1) is more harmful as new students dropping off due to intimidating upfront complexity reduces the growth potential for any field that requires knowledge, experience and practice. Adaptive git-learn (AGL) is designed to overcome these 3 challenges in that order.

Git is a protocol designed for "version control", that efficiently records changes made to text and data across many revisions that allows easily switching between different versions of individual files, directories, the entire project, or any combinations thereof.

AGL designs textbooks using git concepts with several branches, versions and commits. Students can either be directed through the content by an instructor, or use git procedures to skip around and find the level of advancement they are comfortable with for the topic they are working on.

## How to Use
This book can* be read straight from github.com using the repository viewer and default markdown viewers.

Preferably, a basic understanding of git is useful* to use this AGL book to its full potential.

Running code may* require checking out the repository or downloading code folders to run locally.

Start from the [`master`](https://github.com/keerthik/code-book/) branch of the repository. Use any cues in the content to switch to a branch with more in-context detail where needed. See the root `README` file for tips on branches for basic topics.

This section will constantly evolve based on the branch and feedback from readers.

\* *Doesn't mean it's necessary*

## New Resources
To create a new AGL "book" or resource for a topic sufficiently different from $CODE-BOOK, retaining most of this about folder

# Disclaimer
This repository is a **proof of concept** and **work in progress**

## Development
The ideal state for this book is probably not being viewed on github.com as a standard repository, developed by typing raw text into .md files. However, this is a very powerful framework for us to test this concept and work on the content.
