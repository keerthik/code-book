# Adaptive Git-Learn

## Concept
Most textbooks are static in terms of content, and it's up to the reader to pick and choose relevant content. This results in three undesirable learning contexts:
1. Overwhelming details and nuances when being introduced to something new and complex making grokking a subject harder
2. Distracting trivialities and basics when looking to learn an advanced detail of a subtopic
3. Inconsistent pacing increasing complexity results in either boredom or confusion

In general I think (1) is more harmful as new students dropping off due to intimidating upfront complexity reduces the growth potential for any field that requires knowledge, experience and practice. Adaptive git-learn (AGL) is designed to overcome these 3 challenges in that order, better than existing solutions.

Git is a protocol designed for "version control", that efficiently records changes made to text and data across many revisions that allows easily switching between different versions of individual files, directories, the entire project, or any combinations thereof.

AGL designs textbooks using git concepts with several branches, versions and commits. Students can either be directed through the content by an instructor, or use git procedures to skip around and find the level of advancement they are comfortable with for the topic they are working on.
